Okay, this time I wont write what I did earlier. 
Only

Now I am going to try to update/save these notes on this file called: noteTakes
Which is in the noteBook repo.
I want to connect it with the one on my Desktop.


Now, that I am adding to my notes that I opened from my terminal, I will check to see if there are modifications I have to push?

We shall see what happens. See you late!

DANGG!! I cannot get it done.
